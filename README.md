I'm a Software Engineer and Full-Stack Web Developer with a professional background in big box Retail Management, Loss Prevention and Security. Throughout my career, I have always been the person everyone came to for software and hardware related problems.  I would build computers for others and troubleshoot their software related problems.  A common comment that I would always receive from co-workers, friends and family was that I should make a career working with tech.  I started to really think about the possibility of working with computers when my sister recommended that I attend a coding bootcamp over a Thanksgiving dinner conversation.  So I decided to follow my heart and quit a successful retail career for the chance to do something that I enjoy.  Almost one year after that conversation I became a Flatiron School Software Engineering graduate.

I started my career serving in the United States Marine Corps, After an Honorable discharge, I began working as an armed security guard at a domestic violence facility.  Soon after, I enrolled in Police Academy where I earned my Law Enforcement Certification.  While looking for a job as a Police Officer, I started working for the Assets Protection Department at the local Super Target to make ends meet.  I enjoyed the work so much and was promoted so fast that I decided to make that my career.

Eventually, I was offered the chance to work for the Lowe's Home Improvement Assets Protection Department and jumped at the opportunity.  Working for Lowe's was highly regarded in then industry.  They had a top notch Assets Protection program that was also challenging and enabled me to continue to learn and grow. During my tenure at Lowe's I was offered the opportunity to step up as an Assistant Store Manager of challenging high-volume store and proudly accepted that role.
