I‚Äôm a recent graduate of Flatiron School‚Äôs Software Engineering program. I have an extensive professional background in Retail and Loss Prevention Management where I‚Äôve successfully managed 60+ million-dollar businesses and have lead teams of over 200 people.  I‚Äôve also served in military as a US Marine where I was trained in avionics and electronics theory.  My experiences in retail operations exposed me to many of the issues companies face as they struggle to keep up with the pace of technology.  Those experiences drive my passion for developing applications that help businesses effectively run their day-to-day operations.
